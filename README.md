I’m working on making a log monitor so you can see who killed you, and it also shows when a player nearby gets killed. 
It's still a test version, so some things aren't working properly yet, like scrolling back. 
For some reason, I can't get it to stop jumping back to the bottom line every time.
It’s a script that reads the game.log file in the LIVE folder, which is essentially a log of your in-game console.
